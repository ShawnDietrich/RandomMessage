# Random Message Generator Program

## The Overall Purpose

The purpose of this project is to create a terminal style project that will
report a random message whenever a user triggers a response

## Look and Feel

* Create an HTML file that will consist of a button and a message box
* When the user clicks the button a random message will appear
* After all the random messages have been displayed disable the button and report
  a message stating that all messages have expired


## Code Look and Feal

* Use JavaScript to develop the backend code
* Use HTML and CSS for the frontend code
* Make use of objects and store them in a object class
* The main class should only contain code to drive the HTML code
